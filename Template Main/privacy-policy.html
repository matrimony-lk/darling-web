The selection of suppliers with whom Darling shares user personal data is contingent on various factors, such as the specific App, Sites, or services a user engages with. For instance, in delivering our services, we commonly engage the following types of suppliers:</p>

                                    <ul class="list">
                                        <li> Billing Services: Facilitating the purchase of paid features on our App for customers.</li>

                                    Prior to engaging any Service Providers, we conduct thorough due diligence to ensure they have robust data protection and information security measures in place. Additionally, we only share the personal data necessary for the specific service they are providing. Measures are implemented to maximize the non-attribution of shared data, and our suppliers are bound by stringent contractual obligations, including strict limits on data retention.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    While we aim to make our creation accessible to a broad audience, it is a requirement that users of Darling must be at least 18 years old.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    Darling expressly avoids collecting information about or targeting children, minors, or individuals under the age of 18. If we discover that a child, minor, or someone under the age of 18 has registered with us and furnished personal information, we will promptly take measures to cancel that person's registration.</p>


                                    <h3>Duplicate Accounts</h3>
                                    <p>Maintaining multiple accounts goes against our Terms of Service. The retention of email addresses and phone numbers during this period is a preventive measure to curb the misuse of our services.</p>

                                    <h3>Consent and Agreement to Privacy Policy</h3>
                                    <p>Please be aware that the aforementioned policy is explicitly outlined in our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. We document the precise time when each member agrees to these policies.</p>

                                    <h3>Your Options Regarding Information Collection and Use</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    While you have the option to refrain from providing certain information, doing so may limit your access to specific features of our service. This information may be essential for tasks such as user registration, product or service purchases or initiating other transactions.</p>

                                    <p>
                                    Upon deletion of your Account, we ensure its unavailability in the App and initiate the process of erasing your personal information from our systems.

                                    <ul class="list">
                                        <li>Compliance with Applicable Law: We retain certain information if required by law, such as when App purchases result in the need for tax and accounting records.</li>
                                        <li>Ongoing Issues, Claims, or Disputes: If there are outstanding matters, claims, or disputes that necessitate the retention of relevant information until resolution.</li>
                                        <li> Legitimate Business Interests: Information may be retained for our legitimate business interests, including fraud prevention and the enhancement of Users' safety and security. For instance, retaining information may be essential to prevent a previously banned user from engaging in unsafe behavior or security incidents by opening a new account.</li>
                                        <li>We will keep your data for a duration of two years for analytical purposes and maintaining recordkeeping integrity. This retention period is also essential for preventing fraud, recovering any outstanding fees, enforcing our terms and conditions, undertaking actions necessary to safeguard the integrity of our Services or our users, or engaging in other actions permitted by law.</li>

                                    Warning: Despite the removal of information from your profile or the deletion of your Account, copies of such information may still be visible or accessible if previously shared, copied, or stored by others. We disclaim liability for this, as we lack control over such instances. If third-party applications or websites have been granted access to your personal information, they may retain it in accordance with their terms of service or privacy policies.</p>
